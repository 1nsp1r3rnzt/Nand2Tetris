Discrete Mathematics and its Application by Kenneth H. Rosen.


In 50h I was able to finish the first chapter (propositional logic) and achieve 54 exercises.

If I could come back to the beginning of this adventure, I would have studied the different subjects in that order:

I. Basics Mathematics
II. Discrete Mathematics
III. SICP
I would have study Basics and Discrete Mathematics in parallel and then go for the SICP, trying to get the Mathematics knowledge I still miss along the way.
